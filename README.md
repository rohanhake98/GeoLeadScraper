## What you can extract

Business name · category · full address · phone number · website · rating ·
review count · latitude / longitude · opening hours · claimed status · menu /
booking links — and, with the optional backend, **email addresses, phone numbers
and social media links** scraped from each business's own website.

**Reviews** of any single place: author · rating · text (original + Google
translation) · language · publish/edit date · sub-ratings (food, service, price
per person…) · photo links · owner response · review link.

## Supported platforms

## Quick start (install the Chrome extension)

### Install the ready-made build (no coding)
1. Go to **[Releases → latest](https://github.com/ozhehkovski/geoleadscraper/releases/latest)** and download
   **`geoleadscraper-extension-vX.Y.Z.zip`** (not "Source code").
2. Unzip it.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** →
   select the unzipped folder (the one that contains `manifest.json`).

> ⚠️ The green **Code → Download ZIP** button gives you the *source code*, not the
> extension. Loading that folder fails with *"Manifest file is missing or unreadable"* —
> use the Releases zip above, or build it yourself.

### Build from source
Requirements: Node.js >= 20 and pnpm >= 9 (`npm i -g pnpm`).
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:extension
```
Then in Chrome: open `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** →
**Load unpacked** → select `apps/extension/dist`.

📖 Step-by-step install guide with screenshots: **[geoleadscraper.com/install](https://geoleadscraper.com/install)**.

Open Google Maps, search for anything (e.g. *"coffee shops in Berlin"*), click
**Start extracting**, then **Export** to download your CSV. The extension works
**standalone** — Google Maps scraping needs no backend and no login.

To export reviews, open a single place (e.g. click a business in the results),
click **Extract reviews**, wait until the counter stops, then **Export reviews**.
The extension opens the Reviews tab and scrolls it for you; you need to be signed
in to Google, because Maps shows only a limited view without reviews to signed-out users.

### Optional: scrape website contacts (emails / phones / socials)
The only feature that needs a backend is **website contact enrichment**:
```bash
pnpm dev:api
# or: cd apps/api && docker compose up --build
```
Then open the extension **Settings** and set the **Backend URL** (default
`http://localhost:5050`). When it's reachable, email / phone / social columns
become available; otherwise that feature is simply hidden.

### Optional: MCP server (collect leads from Claude)
A built-in [MCP server](apps/api/MCP.md) lets an AI assistant such as Claude run
`collect_maps(...)` to scrape businesses through the extension and analyze them.
See [apps/api/MCP.md](apps/api/MCP.md).

## Development

pnpm dev:api         # run the backend in watch mode
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm test
```

### Releasing
Bump `APP_VERSION` in `apps/extension/packages/shared/config.ts`, merge, then push a
matching tag (`git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0`). The **Extension** GitHub
Action builds the extension and attaches `geoleadscraper-extension-vX.Y.Z.zip` to the release.
